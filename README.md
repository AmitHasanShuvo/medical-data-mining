Data Mining Analysis of mechanisms- based classification of musculoskeletal  pain in clinical practice. K-means, logistic regression, random forests, all the good stuff

The data from this study are a sample of 464 patients, each one assigned to one of the three types of 
pain by a group of experienced physiotherapists. The assessment was carried out according to a list 
of  36  binary  clinical  indicators  (“Present”/“Absent”).  These  indicators  are  selected  on  an  expert 
consensus basis regarding symptoms and features of the patients. Various data mining methods are 
applied to the data answer such questions as: 
1.  Are there any interesting patterns in the presence/absence clinical criteria for lower back 
pain?  
2.  Do the patients form groups with similar presence/absence clinical criteria? Do these groups 
have a connection with the clinical pain types?  
3.  Can we use the presence/absence clinical criteria to accurately predict the clinical pain types?
